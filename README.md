Airbnb is one of the largest online marketplaces for arranging or offering apartments,
homestays and lodging. The number of bookings and listings are growing fast, there are
over 6 million listings worldwide in 2019. New York is listed as one of the top 10 popular
cities for booking experiences in the world.
The total price of a reservation on Airbnb is based on the nightly rate (based price per
night), which is sole set by the host, plus other fees such as service fees, cleaning fee,
etc. In this project, I will build a pricing model in Python, which aims to help hosts to
determine a proper nightly rate based on the pricing model built from a range of relative
factors in the New York Area.
